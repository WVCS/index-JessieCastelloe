    <h1 style="margin:0px 0px 20px 0%"> Which Makes the Better Pet?  </h1> 
   <p class="intro"> Many people can agree that dogs and cats make great pets as they provide us with companionship and love. They even have been proven to benefit both the physical and mental health of their owners. Dogs and cats stand at the top of the list for most popular pets, and because of this, many people argue about which one makes a better pet. </p> 
   
   <h2 class=subtitle style="margin:0px 0px 40px 0%">Here are just a few reasons why you should consider choosing a dog over a cat.</h2>

<div class="reason1" style="margin:30px 0% 60px 0%"> 
 <img class="layingdog" src="https://parkgate.ca/files/2018/09/Deaf-dog.jpg"> <br/>
  <h3>1.  Dogs are Easy to Train</h3> 
  <p> Dogs are more obedient by nature due to their pack mentality which makes them ready to follow a leader and their desire to please.</p></div>

 <div class="reason2" style="margin:30px 0% 60px 0%"> 
 <img class="companion" src="https://mcmasteroptimalaging.com/images/default-source/blog-post-images/companion-animals.jpg?sfvrsn=418c07d6_4"> <br/>
  <h3>2.  Dogs Make Good Companions</h3> 
  <p> Dogs are loyal and affectionate animals who will provide their owners with unconditional love, comfort, and company. They will be there when they are needed and even when they aren't. </p></div>   
  
     <div class="reason3" style="margin:30px 0% 60px 0%">

  <h3>3.  Dogs are Good Guards</h3> 
  <p>  As pack animals, dogs have an instinct to protect pack members from threats. Owners are considered part of the pack, and because of this, dogs will feel the need to guard their owners. They can also warn owners of potential danger.</p></div> 
    
     <div class="reason4" style="margin:30px 0% 60px 0%">

  <h3>4.  Dogs Keep Owners Active</h3> 
  <p>  Like all animals, dogs need exercise. Taking a dog out for walks and runs benefits both the dog and the owner as it keeps them active and healthy. It serves as a good form of exercise for the dog.  </p></div>

  <h3>5.  There are Many Different Types of Dogs</h3> 
  <p>  The variances in appearances for dogs are greater than for cats. Dogs come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Each dog brings something different to the table. This can make it easier for someone to find a dog that fits their lifestyle. </p></div>
    
 <h2 class=subtitle style="margin:0px 0px 20px 0%">People may think cats make better pets because...</h2>
  <ul class="cats">
    <li>They tend to live longer than dogs</li>
<li>They are easier to potty train</li>
<li>They are better for smaller housing such as apartments</li>
<li>They are more independent and donâ€™t require as much attention as dogs</li>
<li>Cats can clean themselves</li>
 <li>Cats are affectionate and loving too</li> </ul>
